## Description

This website was built to display the progress on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. Features use of custom "Progress Ring" web component that I made specifically for this project. Designed to be responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile.

The site contains 4 sections: About Me, Projects. Education, & Contact Me.

## Installation

This site does not require any installation beyond downloading the files and opening the index.html file. This live site can also be visited [here!](https://johngardiner93.github.io/portfolio-site/)

## Usage

This site features a nav that adapts to the user's device. Use the nav to navigate around the site, or scroll down to view all the sections. The site displays my projects on a timeline. Clicking the image of a project will take you to the live site of that project. Clicking the Github icon in the top left corner of each project image will take you to the repo for that project.

This site features a custom web component in the Education section. The "Progress Ring" web component shows an image of the education source as well as a brief description of the course or institution. Hovering over the progress ring causes an animation to kick off. Clicking the progress ring will take you to the site of that education resource.
